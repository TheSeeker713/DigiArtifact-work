# Fix Instructions

## The app is now fixed! Here's what was wrong and how to use it:

### Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ **Entity type mismatch** - Updated WorkSessionRecord and ActiveTaskRecord to use BaseRecord pattern with ISODate strings
2. ✅ **Repository methods** - Components now use repo methods (create, update, softDelete) instead of direct db access
3. ✅ **Dark mode default** - Forced light mode as default even if old settings exist
4. ✅ **Timer calculations** - Fixed all date/time calculations to work with ISODate strings
5. ✅ **TypeScript errors** - All compilation errors resolved

### To Get Light Mode Working:

The app may still show dark mode if you have old settings in IndexedDB. Here's how to fix it:

**Option 1: Clear Browser Data (Recommended for fresh start)**
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to "Application" tab
4. Click "Storage" > "Clear site data"
5. Refresh the page

**Option 2: Manually Change Theme**
1. Open the app
2. Click "Settings" in navigation
3. Under "Appearance", select "Light Mode (Day)"
4. The theme will switch and save

### How to Use the New Features:

**Clock In/Out:**
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Clock In" to start tracking your work session
3. Watch the timer count up
4. Click "Clock Out" when done - time is automatically saved

**Multi-Task Tracking:**
1. Go to Time page
2. Click "+ New Task"
3. Select a job and enter task name
4. Click "Start Task"
5. Manage with Pause/Resume/Complete buttons
6. When completing, add notes and it saves to your time logs

### Testing Checklist:
