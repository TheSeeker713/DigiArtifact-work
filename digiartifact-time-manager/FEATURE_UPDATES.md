## Database Schema Updates

### New Stores:
1. **work_sessions** (DB version 2)
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string
     clockInTime: number        // Unix timestamp
     clockOutTime: number | null
     status: 'active' | 'completed'
     totalMinutes: number | null
     deleted: boolean
     _createdAt: number
     _modifiedAt: number
   }
   ```
   Indexes: by_status, by_deleted

2. **active_tasks** (DB version 2)
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string
     jobId: string
     taskId: string | null
     taskName: string
     startTime: number          // Unix timestamp
     status: 'running' | 'paused' | 'stopped' | 'completed'
     elapsedMinutes: number
     billable: boolean
     deleted: boolean
     _createdAt: number
     _modifiedAt: number
   }
   ```
   Indexes: by_job, by_status, by_deleted

## Technical Implementation

### Clock In/Out Logic:
1. User clicks "Clock In" → Creates active work session with current timestamp
2. Timer updates every second using setInterval
3. Elapsed time calculated as: `(now - clockInTime) / 1000` seconds
4. User clicks "Clock Out" → Updates session with clockOutTime and totalMinutes
5. Session status changes from 'active' to 'completed'

### Multi-Task Tracking Logic:
1. User creates new task → Stored with 'running' status and current timestamp
2. Timer updates every second for all running tasks
3. Pause → Adds elapsed time to elapsedMinutes, changes status to 'paused'
4. Resume → Resets startTime to now, changes status back to 'running'
5. Complete → 
   - Calculates total time (elapsedMinutes + current elapsed)
   - Creates TimeLogRecord via createTimerLog
   - Marks task as 'completed' and deleted
   - Checks for other running tasks and shows reminder if any exist

### Timer Display:
- Format: HH:MM:SS
- Updates: Every 1000ms via setInterval
- Cleanup: onDestroy clears intervals to prevent memory leaks

## User Experience Enhancements

### Clock In/Out Widget:
- **Visual Feedback**: Green pulsing dot when active
- **Status Text**: "Active" (green) or "Not clocked in" (gray)
- **Large Timer**: Easy-to-read elapsed time display
- **Quick Info**: Clock in time and hours today at a glance
- **Action Button**: Changes from "Clock In" (green) to "Clock Out" (red)

### Multi-Task Tracker:
- **Task Cards**: Each task in its own card with clear status
- **Grid Layout**: 2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green = Running (with pulse animation)
  - Amber = Paused
  - Blue = Complete action
  - Red = Delete
- **Completion Modal**: Prompts for notes and billable status before saving
- **Reminders**: Notifies when other tasks are still running after completing one

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Clock in creates active session
- [x] Timer updates every second
- [x] Clock out calculates correct total time
- [x] Session persists across page reloads
- [x] Start new task with job and task selection
- [x] Multiple tasks (up to 4) run simultaneously
- [x] Pause/resume individual tasks
- [x] Complete task saves to time logs
- [x] Task completion reminder for other running tasks
- [x] Delete tasks before completion
- [x] Theme toggle between light/dark modes
- [x] Help section accessible in navigation
- [x] Database version upgrade from 1 to 2

## Known Limitations

1. **Clock In/Out**: Only one active session at a time (by design)
2. **Multi-Task**: Maximum 4 simultaneous tasks (by design)
3. **Timer Precision**: Updates every 1 second (sufficient for time tracking)
4. **Offline Only**: No sync between devices (IndexedDB is local)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Export work session history
- [ ] Weekly/monthly work session reports
- [ ] Task templates for common workflows
- [ ] Task priority levels
- [ ] Pomodoro timer integration
- [ ] Task time estimates vs actual
- [ ] Break time tracking
- [ ] Daily work session goals

## Browser Compatibility

Tested on:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- Firefox
- Requires: IndexedDB, ES2020+, Svelte 5

## Notes

- All timestamps use Unix milliseconds (Date.now())
- Database version incremented from 1 to 2 automatically on app load
- Existing data is preserved during upgrade
- Light mode now uses appropriate color palette for day use
- Dark mode still available for night work
