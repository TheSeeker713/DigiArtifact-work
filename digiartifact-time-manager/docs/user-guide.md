## Tips & Best Practices

### For Freelancers

2. **Clock in/out daily** to track actual working hours
3. **Use multi-task tracking** when juggling clients
4. **Create jobs upfront** with target hours and rates
5. **Invoice promptly** when milestones are reached
6. **Track expenses** immediately to avoid forgetting

### For Small Agencies
1. **Create separate jobs per client project**
2. **Use deals pipeline** to forecast revenue
3. **Track team time** if multiple people use the tool
4. **Generate weekly reports** for client updates
5. **Monitor billable vs. non-billable** time ratios

### For Contractors
1. **Link time entries to jobs** for accurate invoicing
2. **Use product catalog** for recurring deliverables
3. **Track billable expenses** to pass through to clients
4. **Set payment terms** clearly on invoices
5. **Follow up on overdue invoices** using the status tracker

## Troubleshooting

### Time Not Saving
- **Issue**: Clock in/out doesn't persist
- **Solution**: Check browser IndexedDB is enabled. Clear browser cache and try again.

### Jobs Not Appearing in Dashboard
- **Issue**: Created a job but it's not showing in Per-Job Progress
- **Solution**: Ensure the job has a target hours value set. Only jobs with targets appear on Dashboard.

### Invoice Total Incorrect
- **Issue**: Invoice total doesn't match line items
- **Solution**: Check for tax or discount settings. Recalculate by editing and saving the invoice.

### Performance Issues
- **Issue**: App is slow or laggy
- **Solution**: Enable LOW-END mode in header. This disables animations and improves performance on older devices.

### Data Lost After Closing Browser
- **Issue**: All data disappears when I close the app
- **Solution**: Ensure you're not in Private/Incognito mode. IndexedDB requires normal browsing mode to persist data.

### Theme Not Saving
- **Issue**: Theme resets to dark mode every time
- **Solution**: Clear browser storage (F12 â†’ Application â†’ IndexedDB â†’ Delete "datm-settings"). Refresh and set theme again.
