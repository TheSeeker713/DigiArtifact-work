## üîê Authentication & User Management

### Multi-User Support
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

**Description**: 
Currently, the app is single-user per browser. Add support for multiple user accounts with role-based permissions.

**Features**:
- [ ] User accounts with email/password authentication
- [ ] Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Staff, Contractor)
- [ ] Permission levels per role:
  - **Admin**: Full access to all features
  - **Manager**: View all, edit team's time, approve invoices
  - **Staff**: View own data, log time, submit expenses
  - **Contractor**: Limited access, view assigned jobs only
- [ ] User profile management (name, photo, preferences)
- [ ] Activity audit by user (who created/edited what)
- [ ] Team dashboard showing all users' hours

**Technical Approach**:
1. Add `User` entity with authentication fields
2. Add `userId` foreign key to all entities
3. Implement login/logout flow with session management
4. Add permission checks to all CRUD operations
5. Filter queries by user and role
6. Optional: Sync users to external auth provider (Firebase, Auth0)

**Considerations**:
- Offline-first: Cache credentials locally (encrypted)
- Keep auth optional (single-user mode still works)
- Don't require cloud/server (local-only auth possible)

## üìÖ Calendar Integration

### Export to iCal/Google Calendar
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

**Description**:
Export scheduled work sessions, deadlines, and events to external calendar applications.

**Export Format**:
```ical
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
VERSION:2.0
PRODID:-//DigiArtifact//Time Manager//EN
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:job-abc123@digiartifact.local
DTSTAMP:20251018T120000Z

DTEND:20251020T170000Z
SUMMARY:Work Session - Website Design
DESCRIPTION:Job: ABC Corp Website\nTarget: 8 hours
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
```

**Use Cases**:
- View work schedule in Google Calendar alongside personal events

**Technical Approach**:
1. Generate .ics file from ScheduleRecord entities
2. Add download button to export schedules
3. (Optional) OAuth integration with Google Calendar API
4. Handle timezone conversions properly

## üìß Email & Notifications

### Invoice Email with PDF Attachment
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

**Description**:
Generate PDF invoices and email them directly to clients from the app.

**Features**:
- [ ] Generate PDF invoices from invoice records
  - Use jsPDF or pdfmake library
  - Professional template with logo and branding
  - Itemized line items, tax, totals

  - Attach PDF automatically
- [ ] Track email status (sent, opened, bounced)
- [ ] Resend invoice option
- [ ] CC/BCC support
- [ ] Custom message field per invoice

**Email Template Example**:
```
Subject: Invoice #12345 from DigiArtifact

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your business! Attached is Invoice #12345 for services 
rendered. Payment is due by [Due Date].

Invoice Details:
- Amount: $1,500.00
- Due Date: November 15, 2025
- Payment Methods: Check, ACH, Credit Card

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Technical Approach**:
1. **PDF Generation** (client-side or server-side)
   - Client-side: jsPDF (works offline, limited styling)
   - Server-side: Node.js + Puppeteer (better quality, requires server)
2. **Email Sending** (requires backend or email service)
   - Option 1: Mailto link (opens user's email client with PDF)
   - Option 2: Email API (SendGrid, Mailgun - requires account)
   - Option 3: Self-hosted SMTP server

**Considerations**:
- PDF generation can be slow for large invoices (use Web Worker)
- Email sending breaks offline-first model (make it optional feature)
- Store email history in database (EmailRecord entity)

**Payment Flow**:
1. User creates invoice in app
2. Click "Generate Payment Link" button
3. App calls Stripe API to create payment intent
4. Payment link generated: `https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_...`
5. Link included in emailed invoice
6. Client clicks link, enters card info, pays
7. Stripe webhook notifies app ‚Üí invoice marked paid
8. PaymentRecord created automatically

**Supported Gateways**:
- [ ] **Stripe**: Best developer experience, supports subscriptions
- [ ] **PayPal**: Widely used, familiar to clients
- [ ] **Square**: Popular with small businesses
- [ ] **Authorize.net**: Enterprise-friendly
- [ ] **Cryptocurrency**: Bitcoin, Ethereum (via Coinbase Commerce)

**Technical Approach**:
1. Add payment gateway settings to app (API keys)
2. Integrate Stripe/PayPal SDKs
3. Create payment link generation endpoint
4. Set up webhook listeners for payment confirmation
5. Store payment status and transaction IDs
6. Handle refunds and chargebacks

**Considerations**:
- Payment processing requires internet (not offline)
- Requires merchant accounts (Stripe, PayPal)

}
```

**Use Cases**:

      gamification.types.ts (includes SoundFX, SoundSettings)
  assets/
    sounds/
      clock-in.mp3
      clock-out.mp3
      pomodoro-start.mp3
